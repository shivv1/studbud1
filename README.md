Note: Created a new repo due to an error that was not fixed through gitignore. Initial repo/commits can be found: https://github.com/shivv1/studbud

I made a number of changes throughout the development process. In part due to iteration and improvement and also to adjust the design to something I could viably code; taking my skill level at the end of sem in consideration.

## Header & Pages
![Initial Header](/public/images/nav1.png)

My initial idea was to split my web app into 2 pages. The first being made to facilitate/support a study session and the 2nd page being to help plan tasks. After consulting my peers and tutor I realised it was unecessary to split the two as the users should be able to access their tasks on the plan page and there would be no point having it on a separate page if they could just do it on the one. I removed the second page and adjusted the logo to be centred for aesthetic purposes.

## Pomodoro
![Initial Pomodoro](/public/images/pom1.png)

My initial pomodoro featured the counter in the centre of the window and buttons below. I wanted the buttons to be confined to inside the window so as to create more white space and be visually consistent with the rest of my design, I updated the design to that. I also followed a tutorial which had a similar look to the design I initially had in mind for the pomodoro and I preferred it. Unfortunately I was unable to make a pomodoro that was editable so I excluded that button. The pomodoro also now toggles different shades of purple depending on which mode the user is currently in (timer or break).

Future Development:
* Allow user to edit time
* Separate reset button as reset is currently achieved by re-clicking the mode button. Not ideal as it is not entirely obvious to the user.
* A sound or similar to indicate a timer is done
* Different sized breaks
* Automatic intervals between breaks

## Music Player

I was most disappointed with being unable to code a working music player as I'd imagined it and having to resort to a default player.

Future Development: 
* Working Player! Being able to skip between songs.


## Stopwatch

I did not change much about the stopwatch other than altering the buttons to be words instead of symbols to remain internally consistent with the rest of my design.

Future Development:
* A lap feature

## Kanban/To-Do
![Initial Kanban](/public/images/kan1.png)
I decided to combine my task list and kanban board as I had removed the second page and the features were quite similar and would essentially perform the same task. I was able to get a functional task list as I had worked on it during class however I was unable to create draggable elements between kanban lists and create a new column. The design remained relatively similar and resized the way I intended it to as well.

Overall, evidently I was pretty letdown by my coding skills and unable to implement my design as fully intended.
